# Math Competiton
Math Competition App - it is for a hackathon 

This application was made during a EduHack solving the problem of kids not liking math.

According to a survey conducted by Texas Instrumental Company, 46% enjoy math, 24% dislike math, and 30% are in the middle.

Almost a quarter of students dislike math! That percentage is way too high! One of the main reasons why kids hate math is because it just not fun, according to Oxford Learning. 

This is our problem that we are trying to solve: too many kids dislike math because it is just not fun.

We have created an application to solve this problem. This application has a fun leveling system - when one answers a math question right, they go up a level. This incentives kids to get the question correct to try to get the highest level possible! This makes math education, yet fun at the same time.

About the application: the application starts on a homepage, waiting for the user to click start. The user is brought to a new page where they can choose what level of math they would like to do - 1st-12th grade. Subsequently, the user is asked to answer a math question for that level of math they chose. If they get the question correct, they go up a level, if they get the question wrong, they lose and are prompted to return to the homescreen where they can play again.

What we used to build this project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VSCode, and GitHub.

Challenges we faced: We had challenges using GitHub, we were at first unable to collaborate on a project together, but as the Hackathon went on, we quickly learned how to use it. For example, how to add collaborators, what are pull requests, etc.
